Acids were noted for their sour taste (though tasting them is highly discouraged in a lab setting due to their corrosive nature) and their ability to dissolve certain substances. Bases, on the other hand, were characterized by their bitter taste (again, not to be tasted!) and slippery feel.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Ancient civilizations used vinegar (acetic acid) for cleaning and preserving food. Soap, a basic substance, was known for its cleansing properties.</p>\n\n<h4>Lavoisier's oxygen theory of acids</h4>\n<p>Antoine Lavoisier proposed that oxygen was a necessary component of all acids. He believed that the presence of oxygen was what conferred acidic properties upon a substance. This theory was later proven incorrect, but it marked an early attempt to define acidity based on elemental composition.</p>\n<p><b>Limitation:</b> While many acids contain oxygen (e.g., sulfuric acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), hydrochloric acid (HCl) does not, demonstrating that oxygen is not essential for acidity.</p>\n\n<h4>Liebig's hydrogen theory of acids</h4>\n<p>Justus von Liebig proposed that acids contained replaceable hydrogen atoms. This theory was a significant improvement over Lavoisier's. He correctly identified hydrogen as the key element responsible for acidic properties. However, this theory didn't fully explain the behavior of bases or acids in non-aqueous solutions.</p>\n<p><b>Refinement:</b> Liebig's theory laid the groundwork for later acid-base theories, highlighting the importance of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>).</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: General Properties of Acids</h3>\n\n<h4>Sour taste (use caution!)</h4>\n<p>Acids typically have a sour taste. <b>However, it's crucial to understand that tasting acids is extremely dangerous and should never be done in a laboratory or unsupervised setting.</b></p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Lemon juice (citric acid) and vinegar (acetic acid) have a sour taste.</p>\n\n<h4>Corrosive nature</h4>\n<p>Acids are often corrosive, meaning they can damage or destroy other substances upon contact. This is due to their ability to react with and break down chemical bonds.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is highly corrosive and can cause severe burns.</p>\n\n<h4>Reaction with metals to produce hydrogen gas</h4>\n<p>Many acids react with certain metals to produce hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and a metallic salt. This reaction is an example of a single displacement reaction.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> Metal + Acid → Salt + Hydrogen Gas</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Zinc metal reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce zinc chloride and hydrogen gas:</p>\n<p>Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>(g)</p>\n\n<h4>Litmus test (turns blue litmus red)</h4>\n<p>Litmus paper is a common indicator used to test for acidity and basicity. Acids turn blue litmus paper red.</p>\n<p><b>Procedure:</b> Dip a piece of blue litmus paper into the solution being tested. If the paper turns red, the solution is acidic.</p>\n\n<h4>Neutralization of bases</h4>\n<p>Acids react with bases in a process called neutralization. This reaction produces a salt and water. The pH of the resulting solution moves closer to neutral (pH 7).</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> Acid + Base → Salt + Water</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium chloride (table salt) and water:</p>\n<p>HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: General Properties of Bases</h3>\n\n<h4>Bitter taste (use caution!)</h4>\n<p>Bases typically have a bitter taste. <b>Like acids, tasting bases is extremely dangerous and should be avoided.</b></p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Quinine, a component of tonic water, has a bitter taste.</p>\n\n<h4>Slippery feel</h4>\n<p>Bases often have a slippery or soapy feel to the touch. This is because they react with the oils on your skin to form soap-like substances. However, *do not* test the strength of a chemical by touching it!</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Soap and many cleaning products are basic and have a slippery feel.</p>\n\n<h4>Litmus test (turns red litmus blue)</h4>\n<p>Bases turn red litmus paper blue.</p>\n<p><b>Procedure:</b> Dip a piece of red litmus paper into the solution being tested. If the paper turns blue, the solution is basic.</p>\n\n<h4>Neutralization of acids</h4>\n<p>Bases react with acids in a neutralization reaction, producing a salt and water.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> Acid + Base → Salt + Water</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Sodium hydroxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce sodium chloride and water:</p>\n<p>NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Common Examples of Acids and Bases</h3>\n\n<h4>Acids: Hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), acetic acid (CH3COOH)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Hydrochloric acid (HCl):</b> A strong acid found in gastric juice in the stomach, used in industrial cleaning and etching.</li>\n  <li><b>Sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>):</b> A strong acid used in fertilizers, detergents, and car batteries.</li>\n  <li><b>Acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH):</b> A weak acid found in vinegar, used as a food preservative and flavoring agent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Bases: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ammonia (NH3)</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH):</b> A strong base, also known as lye or caustic soda, used in soap making, drain cleaners, and paper production.</li>\n  <li><b>Potassium hydroxide (KOH):</b> A strong base used in liquid soaps, fertilizers, and alkaline batteries.</li>\n  <li><b>Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>):</b> A weak base used in fertilizers, cleaning products, and as a refrigerant.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Chapter 2: Acid-Base Theories - Exam Preparation</h2>\n\n<h3>Topic: Arrhenius Theory</h3>\n\n<h4>Acid: A substance that produces H+ ions in water</h4>\n<p>According to the Arrhenius theory, an acid is a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) when dissolved in water. These hydrogen ions are responsible for the acidic properties of the solution.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Hydrochloric acid (HCl) dissociates in water to form H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions:</p>\n<p>HCl(aq) → H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Base: A substance that produces OH- ions in water</h4>\n<p>An Arrhenius base is a substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>-</sup>) when dissolved in water. These hydroxide ions are responsible for the basic properties of the solution.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissociates in water to form Na<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions:</p>\n<p>NaOH(aq) → Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Limitations of the Arrhenius theory (applies only to aqueous solutions)</h4>\n<p>The Arrhenius theory has limitations because it only applies to aqueous solutions (i.e., solutions where water is the solvent). It does not explain acid-base behavior in non-aqueous solvents or reactions that do not involve H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> ions.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> The reaction between ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen chloride (HCl) in the gas phase to form ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) is an acid-base reaction, but it doesn't involve water, so the Arrhenius theory doesn't apply.</p>\n<p>NH<sub>3</sub>(g) + HCl(g) → NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(s)</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Bronsted-Lowry Theory</h3>\n\n<h4>Acid: A proton (H+) donor</h4>\n<p>The Bronsted-Lowry theory defines an acid as a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) donor. It is a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion to another substance.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> In the reaction between HCl and water, HCl donates a proton to water, making it a Bronsted-Lowry acid:</p>\n<p>HCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Base: A proton (H+) acceptor</h4>\n<p>A Bronsted-Lowry base is a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) acceptor. It is a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion from another substance.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> In the reaction between ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and water, ammonia accepts a proton from water, making it a Bronsted-Lowry base:</p>\n<p>NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Conjugate acid-base pairs</h4>\n<p>In a Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reaction, an acid donates a proton to a base, forming a conjugate acid and a conjugate base. A conjugate acid is formed when a base accepts a proton, and a conjugate base is formed when an acid donates a proton.  The acid and base are referred to as a conjugate pair. The acid has one more H than its conjugate base.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<p>HCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>HCl (acid) and Cl<sup>-</sup> (conjugate base) form a conjugate pair.</li>\n  <li>H<sub>2</sub>O (base) and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (conjugate acid) form a conjugate pair.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Amphoteric substances (can act as both acids and bases)</h4>\n<p>Amphoteric substances can act as both Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases, depending on the reaction conditions. Water is a classic example of an amphoteric substance.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> In the reaction with HCl, water acts as a base, accepting a proton to form H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>.</p>\n<p>HCl(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n<p>In the reaction with NH<sub>3</sub>, water acts as an acid, donating a proton to form OH<sup>-</sup>.</p>\n<p>NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Lewis Theory</h3>\n\n<h4>Acid: An electron pair acceptor</h4>\n<p>The Lewis theory defines an acid as an electron pair acceptor. It is a substance that can accept a pair of electrons from another substance to form a covalent bond.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Boron trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>) is a Lewis acid because it can accept an electron pair from ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>).</p>\n\n<h4>Base: An electron pair donor</h4>\n<p>A Lewis base is an electron pair donor. It is a substance that can donate a pair of electrons to another substance to form a covalent bond.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is a Lewis base because it can donate its lone pair of electrons to boron trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>).</p>\n\n<h4>Lewis acid-base adducts</h4>\n<p>When a Lewis acid and a Lewis base react, they form a Lewis acid-base adduct, which is a compound formed by the donation of an electron pair from the base to the acid, forming a coordinate covalent bond.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> The reaction between BF<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> forms an adduct where nitrogen and boron are connected by a coordinate covalent bond.</p>\n\n<h4>Broader application than Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry theories</h4>\n<p>The Lewis theory has a broader application than the Arrhenius and Bronsted-Lowry theories because it is not limited to aqueous solutions or proton transfer reactions. It can explain acid-base behavior in a wider range of chemical systems, including reactions involving metal complexes and organic compounds.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> The reaction between a metal ion (e.g., Ag<sup>+</sup>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to form a complex ion ([Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>) is a Lewis acid-base reaction.</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Comparing Acid-Base Theories</h3>\n\n<h4>Strengths and weaknesses of each theory</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Arrhenius Theory:</b> Simple and useful for understanding acid-base behavior in aqueous solutions.  However, limited to aqueous solutions and substances that produce H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> ions.</li>\n  <li><b>Bronsted-Lowry Theory:</b> More general than the Arrhenius theory because it doesn't require water.

One water molecule donates a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) to another, forming a hydronium ion (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>) and a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>-</sup>).</p>\n\n<h4>The ion-product constant for water (Kw)</h4>\n<p>The ion-product constant for water (K<sub>w</sub>) is the equilibrium constant for the autoionization of water. It represents the product of the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions at a given temperature.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> K<sub>w</sub> = [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>-</sup>]</p>\n<p>At 25°C, K<sub>w</sub> = 1.0 x 10<sup>-14</sup>.</p>\n\n<h4>Relationship between [H3O+] and [OH-]</h4>\n<p>In pure water, the concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions are equal. When an acid is added, [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] increases, and [OH<sup>-</sup>] decreases to maintain the K<sub>w</sub> value. Conversely, when a base is added, [OH<sup>-</sup>] increases, and [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] decreases.</p>\n<p><b>Relationship:</b> [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] = K<sub>w</sub> / [OH<sup>-</sup>] and [OH<sup>-</sup>] = K<sub>w</sub> / [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: pH Scale</h3>\n\n<h4>Definition of pH and pOH</h4>\n<p>pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution. It is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydronium ion concentration.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> pH = -log[H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>]</p>\n<p>pOH is a measure of the hydroxide ion concentration. It is defined as the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydroxide ion concentration.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> pOH = -log[OH<sup>-</sup>]</p>\n\n<h4>Relationship between pH and pOH (pH + pOH = 14)</h4>\n<p>At 25°C, the sum of pH and pOH is always equal to 14.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> pH + pOH = 14</p>\n<p>This relationship is derived from the K<sub>w</sub> value: K<sub>w</sub> = [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>-</sup>] = 1.0 x 10<sup>-14</sup>. Taking the negative logarithm of both sides gives pH + pOH = 14.</p>\n\n<h4>Acidic, basic, and neutral solutions</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Acidic solutions:</b> pH < 7</li>\n  <li><b>Basic solutions:</b> pH > 7</li>\n  <li><b>Neutral solutions:</b> pH = 7</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Using pH indicators</h4>\n<p>pH indicators are substances that change color depending on the pH of the solution. They are used to visually determine the approximate pH of a solution.</p>\n<p><b>Examples:</b> Litmus paper, phenolphthalein, methyl orange.</p>\n<p><b>How they work:</b> Each indicator has a specific pH range over which it changes color. The color change occurs when the indicator molecule either gains or loses a proton, altering its electronic structure and thus its color.</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Strong Acids and Strong Bases</h3>\n\n<h4>Complete ionization in water</h4>\n<p>Strong acids and strong bases completely dissociate or ionize in water, meaning that virtually all of the acid or base molecules break apart into ions.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Hydrochloric acid (HCl) completely dissociates in water:</p>\n<p>HCl(aq) → H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n<p>Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) completely dissociates in water:</p>\n<p>NaOH(aq) → Na<sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Calculating pH of strong acid and strong base solutions</h4>\n<p>Since strong acids and bases completely ionize, the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> is equal to the initial concentration of the acid or base.</p>\n<p><b>For Strong Acids:</b> [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] = [Acid], so pH = -log[Acid]</p>\n<p><b>For Strong Bases:</b> [OH<sup>-</sup>] = [Base], so pOH = -log[Base], and pH = 14 - pOH</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> What is the pH of a 0.01 M solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl)?</p>\n<p>[H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] = 0.01 M</p>\n<p>pH = -log(0.01) = 2</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Weak Acids and Weak Bases</h3>\n\n<h4>Partial ionization in water</h4>\n<p>Weak acids and weak bases only partially ionize in water, meaning that only a fraction of the acid or base molecules break apart into ions. At equilibrium, there will be a mixture of both the non-ionized acid or base and its ions.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) partially dissociates in water:</p>\n<p>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH(aq) ⇌ H<sup>+</sup>(aq) + CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n<p>Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) partially reacts with water:</p>\n<p>NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)</p>\n\n<h4>Acid ionization constant (Ka)</h4>\n<p>The acid ionization constant (K<sub>a</sub>) is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of a weak acid in water. It measures the strength of the acid; higher K<sub>a</sub> values indicate a stronger acid (more ionization).</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> K<sub>a</sub> = [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>][A<sup>-</sup>] / [HA], where HA is the weak acid and A<sup>-</sup> is its conjugate base.</p>\n\n<h4>Base ionization constant (Kb)</h4>\n<p>The base ionization constant (K<sub>b</sub>) is the equilibrium constant for the ionization of a weak base in water. It measures the strength of the base; higher K<sub>b</sub> values indicate a stronger base (more ionization).</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> K<sub>b</sub> = [BH<sup>+</sup>][OH<sup>-</sup>] / [B], where B is the weak base and BH<sup>+</sup> is its conjugate acid.</p>\n\n<h4>Relationship between Ka and Kb for conjugate acid-base pairs (Ka * Kb = Kw)</h4>\n<p>For a conjugate acid-base pair, the product of the acid ionization constant (K<sub>a</sub>) and the base ionization constant (K<sub>b</sub>) is equal to the ion-product constant for water (K<sub>w</sub>).</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> K<sub>a</sub> * K<sub>b</sub> = K<sub>w</sub></p>\n<p>This relationship allows you to calculate the K<sub>b</sub> value for a conjugate base if you know the K<sub>a</sub> value for its conjugate acid, and vice versa.</p>\n\n<h4>Calculating pH of weak acid and weak base solutions using ICE tables</h4>\n<p>ICE tables (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) are used to calculate the equilibrium concentrations of ions in weak acid and weak base solutions.  These are then used to calculate pH.</p>\n\n<p><b>Steps:</b></p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Write the balanced equilibrium equation.</li>\n  <li>Set up the ICE table:\n     <ul>\n       <li>Initial: Write the initial concentrations of the acid/base and its ions.</li>\n       <li>Change:  Determine the change in concentration (usually \"+x\" or \"-x\").</li>\n       <li>Equilibrium: Write the equilibrium concentrations (Initial + Change).</li>\n     </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Write the expression for K<sub>a</sub> or K<sub>b</sub> and substitute the equilibrium concentrations from the ICE table.</li>\n  <li>Solve for x.  (If K<sub>a</sub> or K<sub>b</sub> is small, you can often approximate that x is negligible compared to the initial concentration).</li>\n  <li>Calculate [H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] or [OH<sup>-</sup>] from x.</li>\n  <li>Calculate pH or pOH.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><b>Example:</b> Calculate the pH of a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), given that K<sub>a</sub> = 1.8 x 10<sup>-5</sup>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nCH3COOH(aq)  ⇌   H+(aq)   +   CH3COO-(aq)\nI     0.1             0          0\nC     -x             +x         +x\nE   0.1 - x           x          x\n\nKa = [H+][CH3COO-] / [CH3COOH]\n1.  8 x 10^-5 = x*x / (0.1 - x)\n\nAssume x is small compared to 0.1, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1\n1.  8 x 10^-5 = x^2 / 0.1\nx^2 = 1.8 x 10^-6\nx = 1.34 x 10^-3\n\n[H+] = x = 1.34 x 10^-3 M\npH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3) = 2.87\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3>Topic: Percent Ionization</h3>\n\n<h4>Calculating percent ionization of weak acids and bases</h4>\n<p>Percent ionization is the percentage of acid or base molecules that ionize in solution. It is calculated by dividing the concentration of ions formed at equilibrium by the initial concentration of the acid or base, and then multiplying by 100%.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Percent Ionization (Acid) = ([H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>] / [HA]<sub>initial</sub>) * 100%</li>\n  <li>Percent Ionization (Base) = ([OH<sup>-</sup>] / [B]<sub>initial</sub>) * 100%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Factors affecting percent ionization</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Initial concentration:</b> Percent ionization decreases as the initial concentration of the weak acid or base increases. This is due to Le Chatelier's principle; as the concentration of the acid/base increases, the equilibrium shifts towards the non-ionized form.</li>\n  <li><b>Temperature:</b> Changes in temperature can affect the equilibrium constant (K<sub>a</sub> or K<sub>b</sub>), which in turn affects the percent ionization.</li>\n  <li><b>Presence of common ions:</b> The presence of a common ion (an ion already present in the solution) decreases the percent ionization of the weak acid or base (Common Ion Effect).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Chapter 4: Acid-Base Titrations - Exam Preparation</h2>\n\n<h3>Topic: Introduction to Titrations</h3>\n\n<h4>Definition of titration</h4>\n<p>Titration is a quantitative analytical technique used to determine the concentration of a substance (analyte) by reacting it with a solution of known concentration (titrant).</p>\n\n<h4>Purpose of titration (determining concentration)</h4>\n<p>The main purpose of titration is to accurately determine the concentration of an unknown solution by carefully reacting it with a solution of known concentration. This is done by measuring the volume of titrant required to completely react with the analyte.</p>\n\n<h4>Titrant, analyte, and indicator</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Titrant:</b> A solution of known concentration that is added to the analyte in the titration. Also known as the standard solution.</li>\n  <li><b>Analyte:</b> The solution of unknown concentration that is being titrated.</li>\n  <li><b>Indicator:</b> A substance that changes color at or near the equivalence point of the titration, allowing the endpoint to be visually determined.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Topic: Titration Curves</h3>\n\n<h4>Plotting pH vs. volume of titrant added</h4>\n<p>A titration curve is a graph that plots the pH of the solution being titrated against the volume of titrant added. Titration curves provide valuable information about the progress of the titration, including the equivalence point and the buffering region (if applicable).</p>\n\n<h4>Titration curves for strong acid-strong base titrations</h4>\n<p>In a strong acid-strong base titration, the pH changes gradually at first, then experiences a very sharp increase or decrease near the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs at pH 7 because the reaction produces a neutral salt and water.</p>\n\n<h4>Titration curves for weak acid-strong base titrations</h4>\n<p>In a weak acid-strong base titration, the initial pH is higher than in a strong acid titration. The titration curve has a buffering region before the equivalence point, where the pH changes gradually. The equivalence point occurs at a pH greater than 7 because the conjugate base of the weak acid hydrolyzes (reacts with water) to produce hydroxide ions.</p>\n\n<h4>Titration curves for strong acid-weak base titrations</h4>\n<p>In a strong acid-weak base titration, the initial pH is lower than in a strong base titration. The titration curve has a buffering region before the equivalence point. The equivalence point occurs at a pH less than 7 because the conjugate acid of the weak base hydrolyzes to produce hydronium ions.</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Equivalence Point</h3>\n\n<h4>Definition of equivalence point</h4>\n<p>The equivalence point in a titration is the point at which the amount of titrant added is stoichiometrically equivalent to the amount of analyte in the solution. In other words, the moles of titrant added equals the moles of analyte present (taking into account any stoichiometric coefficients).</p>\n\n<h4>Determining the equivalence point from a titration curve</h4>\n<p>The equivalence point can be determined from a titration curve by finding the point where the pH changes most rapidly (steepest slope). This is often the inflection point of the curve. For strong acid-strong base titrations, the equivalence point is at pH 7. For weak acid-strong base titrations, it's above 7, and for strong acid-weak base titrations, it's below 7.</p>\n\n<h4>Stoichiometry at the equivalence point</h4>\n<p>At the equivalence point, the moles of acid are equal to the moles of base, taking into account the stoichiometry of the reaction.</p>\n<p><b>Formula:</b> moles of acid = moles of base (or moles of acid * stoichiometric coefficient = moles of base * stoichiometric coefficient)</p>\n<p>This allows you to determine the concentration of the unknown solution using the known concentration of the titrant and the volumes of both solutions.</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Indicator Selection</h3>\n\n<h4>Choosing an appropriate indicator for a titration</h4>\n<p>Selecting the right indicator is crucial for an accurate titration. The indicator should change color as close as possible to the equivalence point. The pH range of the indicator should overlap with the steep portion of the titration curve near the equivalence point.</p>\n\n<h4>Indicator range and pH at the equivalence point</h4>\n<p>Each indicator has a specific pH range over which it changes color. The ideal indicator has a color change range that includes the pH at the equivalence point. For example, phenolphthalein has a color change range of 8.3 - 10.0, making it suitable for titrations where the equivalence point is around pH 9.</p>\n\n<h4>Common acid-base indicators</h4>\n<ul>\n  <li><b>Phenolphthalein:</b> Colorless in acidic solutions, pink in basic solutions (pH range: 8.3 - 10.0).</li>\n  <li><b>Methyl Orange:</b> Red in acidic solutions, yellow in basic solutions (pH range: 3.1 - 4.4).</li>\n  <li><b>Bromothymol Blue:</b> Yellow in acidic solutions, blue in basic solutions (pH range: 6.0 - 7.6).  Ideal for titrations with a near-neutral equivalence point.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Topic: Calculations in Titrations</h3>\n\n<h4>Calculating the concentration of an unknown solution</h4>\n<p>To calculate the concentration of an unknown solution, use the following formula:</p>\n<p>M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub></p>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>M<sub>1</sub> = Molarity of the titrant (known)</li>\n  <li>V<sub>1</sub> = Volume of the titrant used</li>\n  <li>M<sub>2</sub> = Molarity of the analyte (unknown)</li>\n  <li>V<sub>2</sub> = Volume of the analyte</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This formula applies when the stoichiometric ratio between the acid and base is 1:1. If the ratio is different, you need to adjust the formula accordingly.</p>\n\n<h4>Using stoichiometry to determine the amount of acid or base present</h4>\n<p>At the equivalence point, the moles of acid and base are stoichiometrically equivalent. Use the balanced chemical equation to determine the mole ratio between the acid and base.</p>\n<p><b>Example:</b> Consider the titration of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):</p>\n<p>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) → Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>(aq) + 2H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>\n<p>In this reaction, 1 mole of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> reacts with 2 moles of NaOH.  Therefore, at the equivalence point, moles H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> * 2 = moles NaOH.</p>\n\n<h2>Chapter 5: Buffer Solutions - Exam Preparation</h2>\n\n<h3>Topic: Introduction to Buffer Solutions</h3>\n\n<h4>Definition of a buffer solution</h4>\n<p>A buffer solution is an aqueous solution that resists changes in pH upon the addition of small amounts of acid or base. This ability to resist pH changes is crucial in many chemical and biological systems.</p>\n\n<h4>Importance of buffers in biological systems</h4>\n<p>Buffers are essential in biological systems to maintain a stable pH, which is crucial for the proper functioning of enzymes and other biological molecules. For example, blood contains several buffer systems that maintain the pH within a narrow range (7.35 - 7.45).</p>\n\n<h4>Composition of a buffer solution (weak acid and its conjugate base, or weak base and its conjugate acid)</h4>\n<p>A buffer solution typically consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A weak acid and its conjugate base (e.g., acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and acetate ion (CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup>)).</li>\n  <li>A weak base and its conjugate acid (e.g., ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and ammonium ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>)).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Topic: How Buffers Work</h3>\n\n<h4>Mechanism of action of a buffer</h4>\n<p>A buffer works by neutralizing small amounts of added acid or base. The weak acid component of the buffer neutralizes added base, while the conjugate base component neutralizes added acid.</p>\n\n<h4>Resisting changes in pH upon addition of acid or base</h4>\n<p>When acid (H<sup>+</sup>) is added to a buffer solution, the conjugate base reacts with it, converting it to the weak acid and minimizing the pH change.</p>\n<p>A<sup>-</sup>(aq) + H<sup>+</sup>(aq) → HA(aq)</p>\n<p>When base (OH<sup>-</sup>) is added to a buffer solution, the weak acid reacts with it, converting it to the conjugate base and minimizing the pH change.</p>\n<p>HA(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq) → A<sup>-</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l)</p>\n\n<h4>Neutralizing added H+ or OH- ions</h4>\n<p>The buffer components react with the added H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>-</sup> ions, preventing them from significantly altering the pH of the solution. The buffer's ability to neutralize these ions is limited by the concentrations of the weak acid and conjugate base.</p>\n\n<h3>Topic: Buffer Capacity</h3>\n\n<h4>Definition of buffer capacity</h4>\n<p>Buffer capacity is the amount of acid or base that a buffer solution can neutralize before the pH begins to change significantly. It is a measure of the effectiveness of the buffer.</p>\n\n<h4>Factors affecting buffer capacity (concentrations of the weak acid/base and its conjugate)</h4>\n<p>",
